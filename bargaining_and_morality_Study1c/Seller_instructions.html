            In this part of the experiment, you are randomly assigned to the role of a SELLER and randomly matched with another participant, a BUYER, with whom you should haggle over the price of a certain item.<p>
            Your payment for this stage depends on the price you and the buyer agree on. The higher the price, the more you profit, so you should take the negotiation as seriously as possible, and try to reach the best result you can (by maximizing the price as much as you can).<p>
            
            Your reservation price (the minimum price you would be willing to accept) and the buyer's reservation price (the maximum price the buyer would be willing to pay) are randomly sampled in the range between 50 to 250 points. <p>
            The bargaining zone is guaranteed to be positive. This means that it is surely possible to reach an agreement that is profitable for both you and the buyer.
            <p>
            
            Your payment for this stage will be based on the distance between the negotiated price and the reservation price, such that you would receive $0.01 (1 cent) for each point. The buyer's payment is similarly based on the distance between his/her reservation price and the negotiated price.
           <p>
            
            For example, if your reservation price has been selected to be 50 points, and you and the buyer agree on a price of 150 points, the distance is 100 points, and your payment will be $1.
If your reservation price has been selected to be 60 points, and you and the buyer agree on a price of 65 points, the distance is 5 points, and your payment will be $0.05 (5 cents).
           <p>
            If you do not reach an agreement, you will not receive payment for this part.
            <p>

            Note that this negotiation is a zero-sum game: the higher your payment, your counterpart's (the buyer) payment is lower, and the higher your counterpart's payment, your payment is lower.
            <p>
            
Your reservation price for the negotiation has been selected to be <b>{{group.SRP}} points</b>. <p>
Your goal is to achieve the best personal outcome you can. 
            <p>
            You have up to five minutes to reach an agreement.
